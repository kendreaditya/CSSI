    - 1. Pitch an idea for an app that would help with sustainability (examples could be recycling, food waste or energy). What features would it have, how would one of these features work and how would it positively impact the user of the app?Â **(200 word max limit)**
        - Evaluate companies biased on their long term sustainability and somehow relate that to stock prices
        - sustainability metric? carbbon footprint

            - Unlike Google, many companies disregard the importance of sustainability overall. Therefore, I propose an app that predicts the long-term viability of companies by using carbon footprints as a metric for evaluation. Specifically, the app will predict the effect of a companies sustainability on their stock prices. Essentially allowing traders to design profitable carbon-neutral investment portfolios. In fact, investing in portfolios with good ESG (Environmental, social and corporate governance) and CSR (Corporate social responsibility) pays more, because it allows companies to better control risks. Thus motivating companies to improve their sustainability.
            - Using data from the GHG Emissions and ESG Dataset, we can use Transformers for time series forecasting to extrapolate future trends of a company's sustainability metrics, such as their carbon footprint. This data, in combination with stock prices will aid invertors in making decisions biased on sustainability. Hence, compelling business to increase their sustainability by adopting the use of clean energy.   
    - 2. Say you are trying to upload a photo to share with a photo sharing app. You see a non-specific error message, like "Sorry, something went wrong." List all the ways you can think of to try to fix or work around the error.Â **(200 word max limit)**
        - Testing test cases
        - Q: How to format?

            - I would retry sharing the photo again without any changes to ensure that it was not a one-time hiccup.
            - Ensure a proper connection is established
                - Connected to WiFi that has internet
            - I would check if all upload requirements are met
                - Â resolution
                - size
                - filename special characters
                - file extension
            - Screenshot the image and try uploading it to ensure there is nothing wrong with the file.
            - I would clear the cache/cookies of the app/website.
            - If the application is on a website, log out. If it is an app, clear the data of the app.
            - If the application is on a website, use a different browser. If it is an app, reinstall the app.
            - I would try uploading the photo from a different device
            - I would try uploading from a different network
            - I would research the message along with the website for potential solutions and causes to the problem
